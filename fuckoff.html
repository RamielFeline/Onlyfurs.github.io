<h1>Sometimes the old, sayings are still king</h1>
	<p>In light of the current and future internet as well as being around durring the birth of dial up internet in the eldest days; The open internet has been one of mankind's greatest acheivements. Limitless pottential for good and limitless potential for evil, as I have seen and experienced there is always going to be someone who is out to get everyone and sorry you might be one of those people or be hunted by one of those kinds of people. Indescriminent malicious attacks on one's life weather it be social security numbers stolen or slander, there are always reasons to be at least a little bit paranoid on the open and closed internet. Once again some of the oldest sayings are still king especially in the digital online space.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Don't talk to strangers</li>
		<li>Treat others the way you want to be treated</li>
		<li>Tread carefully</li>
		<li>Watch where you are going and know where you are and are going</li>
		<li>Keep your private life to yourself</li>
		<li>Be careful what information you put out</li>
		<li>Put out the least amount of information you can</li></ul>
	<p>And one thing I have also learned that I can pass onto you and future generations, everything needs an account nowadays and seems to be getting worse, all of these websites are harvesting behavioral data on you and accounts make it super easy to organize you amongst the millions of others. Choose wisely what websites you are on carefully. If it was up to me the world would have gone back to 2000 again, the internet was new and the big name companies had yet to master data harvesting. With all this harvested data such as names, dates, card numbers, biometrics, images of self and associates, all of those are up for grabs by malicious being behind closed doors, be careful what you say, type, or do. Webcams, phones, tablets, any software you did not look into or build yourself can and will be used against you. Stay safe.</p>
<br>
<h2>Fuck Off</h2>
	<p>You are here because the internet is being censored and ruined by the authoritarian bodies that control the lives of us and those arround us. However as a persevering individual you have taken it upon yourself to seek out uncensored real content. Here you will find videos, pictures, audio, and stories download. The internet has been thrown back a couple decades and quite frankly, this needed to happen as once the internet became normalized and normies were given access to it, that is when everything began to decay. Normie are the reason most other developers gave up on optimization forever ago. In case you didn't notice this site won't lag since its made to run on just about anything that can run a web browser. Just shut up and enjoy your freedom.</p>
