<h1>Welcome to OnlyFurs</h1>
<p>Because normies are fucking cringe. There is much furry content to be seen in the form of audio, pictures and, video. Included in the navigation bar is a PGP tool site for your more secure needs.</p>
<p>In case it wasn't clear this website is always under construction, <b>this is a retrofitted site using the skeleton of a website from 2019.</b> do not @ the webmaster, she will not respond however we do have a complaint's department down bellow.</p>

<h3>Listen up</h3>
<p>At the top of this page you will find nice CSS buttons for "Pictures," "Videos," "Audio," "Stories," and a link to an online PGP tool.<br>Only the "Pictures" tab actually has content to it. If your browser can't fucking deal then thats not my fuckin' problem. If it works you can browse whats available. Also don't ask me to add shit, because this is not your website now is it? What you are looking for may have a chance of popping up on here if it isn't already as that is the goal but if it isn't here and you wanna complain then fucking leave because I'm not gonna have a bunch of babys on this site. Not gonna happen, nothing here is "for the kiddos" or "kid friendly." There will be swearing, there will be sex, and there will be edgy content so if that makes you feel uncomfortable then good. Leave.<br>For whoever actually decided to stay, have a nice day.</p>
