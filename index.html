<h1>Welcome to OnlyFurs</h1>
<p>Because normies are fucking cringe. There is much furry content to be seen in the form of audio, pictures and, video. Included in the navigation bar is a PGP tool site for your more secure needs.</p>
<p>In case it wasn't clear this website is always under construction, <b>this is a retrofitted site using the skeleton of a website from 2019.</b> do not @ the webmaster, she will not respond however we do have a complaint's department down bellow.</p>

<h3>Listen up</h3>
<p>At the top of this page you will find nice CSS buttons for "Pictures," "Videos," "Audio," "Stories," "Hook-Ups," "Projects," "News-Letters," a segment "For the Future," and a link to an online PGP tool.<br>Some tabs have more or less content to them. If your browser can't fucking deal then thats not my fuckin' problem. If it works you can browse whats available. Also don't ask me to add shit, because this is not your website now is it? What you are looking for may have a chance of popping up on here if it isn't already as that is the goal but if it isn't here and you wanna complain then fucking leave because I'm not gonna have a bunch of babys on this site. Not gonna happen, nothing here is "for the kiddos" or "kid friendly." There will be swearing, there will be sex, and there will be edgy content so if that makes you feel uncomfortable then good. Leave.<br>For whoever actually decided to stay, have a nice day.</p>

	<h3>News Letter</h3>
	<h2>{What I have been up to} 23/6/2023</h2>
	<p>Starting with what I have been doing as of late. I am looking to change career to something I actually want to do for once. I figure I can start here at the very least. Becoming a full stack web dev is at least a start, I could at least try to aim for being a platform developer after I get started on that. I am re-learning what I already know of HTML, CSS, JS, through free online cources and then moving onto the rest for backend work, PHP comes to mind but it's very late and I haven't slept for real in about 40 hours. The fact I can even type is a miracle in of itself.<br><br>As much as I would like to say I have been super happy landing the job I have I have been looking more into myself these days, turns out my original thought of what I should do was correct, persue code and programming, thats what I should have actually <strong>tried</strong> to do instead of giving up on such a dream forever ago. Oh well, things happen I guess, live and learn.<br><br>Along the way I have made the most amazing friends I could ever ask for, friends who are supportive, knowledgeable and caring. How I ended up here I don't know other than it took me finally breaking out of my isolative habits and striking up convversations that cultivate into full blown relationships with those amazing people.<br><br>If there is one thing I could think of for what I could pass on to the future generations; <strong>You have dreams and desires for a reason. If you are not good at those things right now, persue them anyways and practice, keep trying, don't give up, and always treat the opportunity to learn as a gift. Swallow your damn pride.</strong></p>
