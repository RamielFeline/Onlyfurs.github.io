<h1>Welcome to OnlyFurs</h1>
<p>Because normies are fucking cringe. There is much furry content to be seen in the form of audio, pictures and, video. Included in the navigation bar is a PGP tool site for your more secure needs.</p>
<p>In case it wasn't clear this website is always under construction, <b>this is a retrofitted site using the skeleton of a website from 2019.</p>

<h3>Listen up</h3>
<p>Don't ask me to add shit, because this is not your website now is it? What you are looking for may have a chance of popping up on here if it isn't already as that is the goal but if it isn't here and you wanna complain then fucking leave because I'm not gonna have a bunch of babies on this site. Not gonna happen, nothing here is "for the kiddos" or "kid friendly." There will be swearing, there will be sex, and there will be edgy content so if that makes you feel uncomfortable then good. Leave.<br>For whoever actually decided to stay, have a nice day.</p>

	<h3>News Letter</h3>
	<h2>{Here comes the rain} 24/9/2023</h2>
	<p>Once again here comes a rainy week. Quite frankly I do preffer the rain. And even with so many different plans in the works for travel and business of various kinds my mind is always at work and yet somehow I can't seem to focus on what I want to learn so easily. I can still do it, I just have to force it to happen, in short my life does not happen without me, your life will not happen without you either.<br><br>The economy silently worsens, money is harder to come by and keep hold of, and no companies want to offer better pay for the worsening economy; such is late stage capitalism, get fucked if you aren't Jeff Bezos or Warren Buffet. I can still make things happen but I need to be working longer hours and maybe that isn't such a bad thing; I can hone my skills at my day job with better pay and I don't have to deal with the things at home. Win-win for me. Then again as people we shouldn't live to just work, as if we had a choice to begin with. As the days get shorter, the working hours seem to scretch on forever and I can't seem to keep a grip on what my friends are up to. On my weekends I am still working hard just to learn my other skills outside of my normal work. Weather that be cloud computing, server administration or lighting tech, I have many things I want to do and yet because of such garbage economic times I have to move elsewhere further away from the things I want to be working with.<br><br><strong>I can see why so many people under 40 years old are so depressed and would not mind just ending it.</strong> It's a depressing world and quite frankly I blame no one.<br><br>Stay strong, eat the rich, fuck the establisment.</p>
