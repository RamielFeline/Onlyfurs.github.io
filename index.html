<h1>Welcome to OnlyFurs</h1>
<p>Because normies are fucking cringe. There is much furry content to be seen in the form of audio, pictures and, video. Included in the navigation bar is a PGP tool site for your more secure needs.</p>
<p>In case it wasn't clear this website is always under construction, do not @ the webmaster, she will not respond however we do have a complaint's department down bellow.</p>
<br>
<h2>Fuck Off</h2>
<p>You are here because the internet is being censored and ruined by the authoritarian bodies that control the lives of us and those arround us. However as a persevering individual you have taken it upon yourself to seek out uncensored real content. Here you will find videos, pictures, audio, and stories download. The internet has been thrown back a couple decades and quite frankly, this needed to happen as once the internet became normalized and normies were given access to it, that is when everything began to decay. Normie are the reason most other developers gave up on optimization forever ago. In case you didn't notice this site won't lag since its made to run on just about anything that can run a web browser. Just shut up and enjoy your freedom.</p>
<p style="background-color:lime;color:black;"><b>This website is intended for the webmaster to use at their leisure. Any other patrons have no say in the matter. If you have a formal complaint you can file it here.<br><button><a href="https://youtu.be/SCsUmdBQwxg">File a complaint</a></button></b></p>

<h1>Sometimes the old, sayings are still king</h1>
<p>In light of the current and future internet as well as being around durring the birth of dial up internet in the eldest days; The open internet has been one of mankind's greatest acheivements. Limitless pottential for good and limitless potential for evil, as I have seen and experienced there is always going to be someone who is out to get everyone and sorry you might be one of those people or be hunted by one of those kinds of people. Indescriminent malicious attacks on one's life weather it be social security numbers stolen or slander, there are always reasons to be at least a little bit paranoid on the open and closed internet. Once again some of the oldest sayings are still king especially in the digital online space.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Don't talk to strangers</li>
	<li>Treat others the way you want to be treated</li>
	<li>Tread carefully</li>
	<li>Watch where you are going and know where you are and are going</li>
	<li>Keep your private life to yourself</li>
	<li>Be careful what information you put out</li>
	<li>Put out the least amount of information you can</li>
</ul>
<p>And one thing I have also learned that I can pass onto you and future generations, everything needs an account nowadays and seems to be getting worse, all of these websites are harvesting behavioral data on you and accounts make it super easy to organize you amongst the millions of others. Choose wisely what websites you are on carefully. If it was up to me the world would have gone back to 2000 again, the internet was new and the big name companies had yet to master data harvesting. With all this harvested data such as names, dates, card numbers, biometrics, images of self and associates, all of those are up for grabs by malicious being behind closed doors, be careful what you say, type, or do. Webcams, phones, tablets, any software you did not look into or build yourself can and will be used against you. Stay safe.</p>

<h3>Image of The Day</h3>
<p>So that last image was there for like 4 years, the title is a lie. That last image was so old the webmaster transitioned and grew tits. Should be called, "Image of the milestone."</p>

<h3>Listen up</h3>
<p>At the top of this page you will find nice CSS buttons for "Pictures," "Videos," "Audio," "Stories," and a link to an online PGP tool.<br>Only the "Pictures" tab actually has content to it. If your browser can't fucking deal then thats not my fuckin' problem. If it works you can browse whats available. Also don't ask me to add shit, because this is not your website now is it? What you are looking for may have a chance of popping up on here if it isn't already as that is the goal but if it isn't here and you wanna complain then fucking leave because I'm not gonna have a bunch of babys on this site. Not gonna happen, nothing here is "for the kiddos" or "kid friendly." There will be swearing, there will be sex, and there will be edgy content so if that makes you feel uncomfortable then good. Leave.<br>For whoever actually decided to stay, have a nice day.</p>
