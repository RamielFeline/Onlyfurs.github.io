<h1>Welcome to OnlyFurs</h1>
<p>Because normies are fucking cringe. There is much furry content to be seen in the form of audio, pictures and, video. Included in the navigation bar is a PGP tool site for your more secure needs.</p>
<p>In case it wasn't clear this website is always under construction, <b>this is a retrofitted site using the skeleton of a website from 2019.</b> do not @ the webmaster, she will not respond however we do have a complaint's department at the bottom of the <a href="fuckoff.html">'For-the-Future'</a> tab.</p>

<h3>Listen up</h3>
<p>At the top of this page you will find nice CSS buttons for "Pictures," "Videos," "Audio," "Stories," "Hook-Ups," "Projects," "News-Letters," a segment "For the Future," and a link to an online PGP tool.<br>Some tabs have more or less content to them. If your browser can't fucking deal then thats not my fuckin' problem. If it works you can browse whats available. Also don't ask me to add shit, because this is not your website now is it? What you are looking for may have a chance of popping up on here if it isn't already as that is the goal but if it isn't here and you wanna complain then fucking leave because I'm not gonna have a bunch of babys on this site. Not gonna happen, nothing here is "for the kiddos" or "kid friendly." There will be swearing, there will be sex, and there will be edgy content so if that makes you feel uncomfortable then good. Leave.<br>For whoever actually decided to stay, have a nice day.</p>

	<h3>News Letter</h3>
	<h2>{Never stop learning} 5/7/2023</h2>
	<p>Where do I start? The past few years have been shockingly productive in learning of one's self as well as the subjects one is intersted in. I have experienced the changes in personality brought on by various life events and meetings with new people. The year is 2023, its July, the day after United States independence day and quite frankly I feel at ease after the rush of emotions that have kicked me in the teeth the past few years. This is the first year in a while that I did not see or hear any fireworks for the 4th of July, it's strangely nice, it's calm.<br><br>While I have been learning and growing from the events had I have had a reignition of old hobbies, likes, and interests, seems like either the depression lessened or it just moved somewhere else in the head, either way I have been taking this time to slow down, declutter my mind and home, and learning to let go of old things so I can move on with my life and actually get somewhere in life. Too bad the world is so fucked when it comes to anything money, it's quite literally impossible to get ahead unless a full economic system crash happens or a massive restructuring, both of which I just do not see happening. Oh well, those born after 1980(?) can get fucked I guess, born too late.<br><br>Honnestly through all the hardships I and my friends have been working through and supporting eachother through I have learned more about myself than over my lifetime previous to the past few years. And I am back to schooling and learning to hone my skills and knowledgebase again so I can hopefully make a nice career change. Going for full stack web dev first and see what happens from there. Maybe land in some place as front end first and keep learning while working there.<br><br><b>Those succeeding never stop learning. May it be about a skill, job, their friends, or themself.</b></p>
