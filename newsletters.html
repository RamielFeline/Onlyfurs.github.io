    <h1>News Letters</h1>
	<p>News letters that have passed their time on the front page can be found here. They are indexed by year as I don't expect to be making a ton of news letters.<br> as per usual these are dated in the format <b>dd/mm/yyyy</b></p>

		<h2>{What I have been up to} 23/6/2023</h2>
		<p>Starting with what I have been doing as of late. I am looking to change career to something I actually want to do for once. I figure I can start here at the very least. Becoming a full stack web dev is at least a start, I could at least try to aim for being a platform developer after I get started on that. I am re-learning what I already know of HTML, CSS, JS, through free online cources and then moving onto the rest for backend work, PHP comes to mind but it's very late and I haven't slept for real in about 40 hours. The fact I can even type is a miracle in of itself.<br><br>As much as I would like to say I have been super happy landing the job I have I have been looking more into myself these days, turns out my original thought of what I should do was correct, persue code and programming, thats what I should have actually <strong>tried</strong> to do instead of giving up on such a dream forever ago. Oh well, things happen I guess, live and learn.<br><br>Along the way I have made the most amazing friends I could ever ask for, friends who are supportive, knowledgeable and caring. How I ended up here I don't know other than it took me finally breaking out of my isolative habits and striking up convversations that cultivate into full blown relationships with those amazing people.<br><br>If there is one thing I could think of for what I could pass on to the future generations; <strong>You have dreams and desires for a reason. If you are not good at those things right now, persue them anyways and practice, keep trying, don't give up, and always treat the opportunity to learn as a gift. Swallow your damn pride.</strong></p>
