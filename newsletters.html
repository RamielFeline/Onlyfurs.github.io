		<h2>{Never stop learning} 5/7/2023</h2>
		<p>Where do I start? The past few years have been shockingly productive in learning of one's self as well as the subjects one is intersted in. I have experienced the changes in personality brought on by various life events and meetings with new people. The year is 2023, its July, the day after United States independence day and quite frankly I feel at ease after the rush of emotions that have kicked me in the teeth the past few years. This is the first year in a while that I did not see or hear any fireworks for the 4th of July, it's strangely nice, it's calm.<br><br>While I have been learning and growing from the events had I have had a reignition of old hobbies, likes, and interests, seems like either the depression lessened or it just moved somewhere else in the head, either way I have been taking this time to slow down, declutter my mind and home, and learning to let go of old things so I can move on with my life and actually get somewhere in life. Too bad the world is so fucked when it comes to anything money, it's quite literally impossible to get ahead unless a full economic system crash happens or a massive restructuring, both of which I just do not see happening. Oh well, those born after 1980(?) can get fucked I guess, born too late.<br><br>Honnestly through all the hardships I and my friends have been working through and supporting eachother through I have learned more about myself than over my lifetime previous to the past few years. And I am back to schooling and learning to hone my skills and knowledgebase again so I can hopefully make a nice career change. Going for full stack web dev first and see what happens from there. Maybe land in some place as front end first and keep learning while working there.<br><br><b>Those succeeding never stop learning. May it be about a skill, job, their friends, or themself.</b></p>

		<h2>{What I have been up to} 23/6/2023</h2>
		<p>Starting with what I have been doing as of late. I am looking to change career to something I actually want to do for once. I figure I can start here at the very least. Becoming a full stack web dev is at least a start, I could at least try to aim for being a platform developer after I get started on that. I am re-learning what I already know of HTML, CSS, JS, through free online cources and then moving onto the rest for backend work, PHP comes to mind but it's very late and I haven't slept for real in about 40 hours. The fact I can even type is a miracle in of itself.<br><br>As much as I would like to say I have been super happy landing the job I have I have been looking more into myself these days, turns out my original thought of what I should do was correct, persue code and programming, thats what I should have actually <strong>tried</strong> to do instead of giving up on such a dream forever ago. Oh well, things happen I guess, live and learn.<br><br>Along the way I have made the most amazing friends I could ever ask for, friends who are supportive, knowledgeable and caring. How I ended up here I don't know other than it took me finally breaking out of my isolative habits and striking up convversations that cultivate into full blown relationships with those amazing people.<br><br>If there is one thing I could think of for what I could pass on to the future generations; <strong>You have dreams and desires for a reason. If you are not good at those things right now, persue them anyways and practice, keep trying, don't give up, and always treat the opportunity to learn as a gift. Swallow your damn pride.</strong></p>
